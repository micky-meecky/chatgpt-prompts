 Step 3:
 So next, I will give you some simple examples.
example 1:
I says:" Please give me an example including "have to","a lot of","professors".
You answers:" ENGLISH: I [have to] find [a lot of] [professors] to get them agreement of protecting enviroment from those (jerks).

中文: 我[必须]找到[很多][教授]，让他们同意保护环境不受那些（混蛋）影响。

EXPLAINATION: 
[have to]: "Have to" is a modal verb that is used to indicate that something is necessary or required. It is often used to express obligation, duty, or compulsion. For example, "I have to go to work today," means that going to work is necessary or required for some reason, such as to earn a living or to fulfill a contractual obligation. "Have to" can also be used to express a strong recommendation or advice. For example, "You have to try the seafood here - it's amazing!" means that it is strongly recommended that you try the seafood because it is very good.

[a lot of]:"A lot of" is a common phrase used to describe a large quantity or number of something. It is often used in place of words such as "many" or "much". For example, "There are a lot of people at the party," means that there are many people there. Similarly, "She has a lot of books on her shelf," means that she has many books on her shelf. "A lot of" can also be used to describe a high degree or frequency of something, such as "He eats a lot of spicy food," meaning that he eats spicy food often or in large quantities.

[professors]:Professors are typically highly educated individuals who hold advanced degrees and have achieved significant expertise in their field of study. They typically work at universities or colleges and are responsible for teaching courses, conducting research, and mentoring students. Professors may specialize in a particular subject area, such as mathematics, science, literature, or history. They are typically expected to publish research findings in academic journals or present them at conferences in order to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their field. Professors may also serve on committees, advise students, and participate in other academic and administrative activities related to their department or university.

EXTRA WORDS or PHRASE:
(jerks):"Jerks" is a colloquial term that is often used to describe a person who is rude, unpleasant, or behaves in an obnoxious manner. The term can refer to a range of behaviors, including being disrespectful to others, behaving arrogantly, or intentionally causing harm or offense to others. In some cases, it may also be used to describe someone who is dishonest or untrustworthy. However, it is important to note that the term is subjective and can be used in a variety of contexts, depending on the situation and the person using it.

 Step 4:
 example 2:
I says:" Please give me an example including"stay in","rental store", "membership card","by virtue of","set  forth".
You answers:" ENGLISH:Opting to [stay in] for the evening, I chose to rent a film from the local [rental store]. [By virtue of] my [membership card], I received a discounted price on the rental. Prior to (venturing out), I [set forth] (on a quest) to locate my misplaced membership card to (facilitate) the rental process.

中文: 决定[宅在家中]度过这个晚上，我选择到当地的[租赁店]中租赁一部电影。[由于]持有[会员卡]，我享受了折扣租赁的价格。在(出门)前，我[着手](寻找)我遗失的会员卡，以(便更加顺利地完成)租赁流程。

EXPLAINATION: 
[Stay in] means to remain at home or indoors, rather than going out.
[Rental store] refers to a place where you can rent items, such as movies or books.
[Membership card] is a card that identifies you as a member of a particular organization or group, such as a rental store.
[By virtue of] means because of or due to a particular quality, advantage, or circumstance.
[Set forth] means to start doing something or to begin a journey. In this example, it means to start looking for the membership card.

EXTRA WORDS or PHRASE:
(venture out):"Venture out" means to leave one's usual or comfortable surroundings and explore or try something new or unfamiliar. It involves taking a risk or stepping outside of one's comfort zone in order to experience something different. For example, "I rarely venture out of my neighborhood, but I decided to try that new restaurant downtown," means that the speaker usually stays in their neighborhood, but decided to take a risk and try a new restaurant in a different part of town. The phrase can also be used to encourage someone to take a risk or try something new, such as "Come on, let's venture out and explore the city!"

(on a quest): "On a quest" means that someone is on a journey or search to find or achieve something specific. It often involves a sense of purpose, determination, and focus on a goal. A quest can be a physical journey, such as exploring a new place or hiking to a remote location, or an internal journey, such as personal growth or self-discovery. For example, "She's on a quest to find the lost city of Atlantis," means that she is determined to locate the mythical city and is actively searching for it. The phrase can also be used more figuratively, such as "He's on a quest to become the best basketball player in the world," meaning that he is working hard to achieve that goal.

(facilitate):"Facilitate" means to make a process or activity easier or more efficient. It involves taking steps to help something happen more smoothly or quickly, or to remove obstacles or barriers that might hinder progress. For example, "The new software is designed to facilitate communication between team members," means that the software is intended to make it easier for team members to communicate with each other.

"
If I have given you too much vocabulary, or if there are so many words and phrases that you need to explain that they are beyond your limits, you can reduce the explanations, for example, in this example, by making the explanations of the words and phrases I have given you as concise as possible.

 If you understand it, pls answer it with just a " I got it".
 
 
 Step 5:
 Congratulations, you now understand the rules.
Also add that when I need to change our rules after joining, I will preface the proposed rule with "rectify our specification: bla-bla..." bla-bla...", and then you'll make the change and reply with "correctify successfully! bla-bla" in the first sentence, okay?
So let's start with a simple sentence.
Rectify our specification: firstly, keep your sentences longer, between 40-60 is best; secondly, use more advanced words to look professional; thirdly: as I said before, use "()" for those words and phrases that you think I might not recognise and explain them later, please refer to the examples given to you before.
 
 Step 6[option to check the rule what chatgpt understand]:
